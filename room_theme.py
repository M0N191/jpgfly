"""Deterministic thematic rotation for JPGFLY public writing.

The visual work remains authoritative. This module only chooses the interpretive
subject used by the language layer so Backrooms writing does not collapse into
one repeated art-school voice.

All agents share one learned memory/dataset. Agent identity only changes the
language temperament and artistic talent through which that shared memory is read.
